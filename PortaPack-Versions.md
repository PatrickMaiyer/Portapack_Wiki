**Portapack Versions**

There are many different versions of PortaPack, mainly due to Chineseâ€™s Companies putting their own take of the design such as adding a larger screen, adding charging or changing the main chip due to price and availability. The current list is:

 Version|Screen size|  AK4951 Codec|  WM8731 SSOP Codec|  WM8731L QFN Codec|  CPLD|  INS8002E Audio amp|  LTK8002D Audio amp|
|----------|-------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|[H1 R1](#H1(R1/R2))|2.4"||:heavy_check_mark:||QFP64|||
|H1 R2|2.4"|:heavy_check_mark:|||QFP64|||
|H2|3.2"|:heavy_check_mark:|||QFP64|||

### Differences:
* The H1R1 has a WM8731 audio chip
* The H1R2 has a AK4951 audio chip
* Some versions have a touch screen while a lot of the clones do not

## H2

### Differences:
* Similar to  H2 in early versions except claim for better TXCO spec(quesionable) and board marked as H2+.
* Battery state indicator with 4 leds under Encoder Knob for 25%,50%,75%,100%,flashing while charging, steady when that level full. 

## H2+R2

### Differences:
* Similar to  H2+R1 except using the WM8731 Codec and  has an added audio power amp INS8002E. The front face of the board is marked as H2+ as in H2+R1 above.
* Battery state indicator with 4 leds under Encoder Knob for 25%,50%,75%,100%,flashing while charging, steady when that level full. 

## H2+R3

### Differences
* Similar to  H2+R2 except
* This versions the standard CPLD 5M40ZE64CN5 was  replaced with EPM240T100C5N ( due to cost and supply issues by supplier "OpenSourceSDR Lab") which has caused some issues ( they issues their work around fixes in a version 1.4.3)  and resolved in version 1.5.x due to a lot of hard work.


## H2+R4

### Differences
* Similar to the H2+R3 except it now uses the AG256SL100 IC as well as the 28 pin QFN WM8731L instead of the 38 pin QFN AK4951. Marked as "PCB v3.6 mmdvm.club". 
* 3W LTK8002D SOP8 Class D amplifier for the speaker (INS8002e clone?).
* Power IC IP5306 SOP8.



## H3
Uses custom close source firmware. **Not compatible with Mayhem. Do not buy or support as it's a scam**


## H2 Plus (It is not "H2+" although they were made by same person)
A clone of H3, Uses custom close source firmware([Ref.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24917424/198536040-e573b98c-e327-4e69-9448-83cea52b02e3.jpg)). **Not compatible with Mayhem([Ref.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24917424/198536040-e573b98c-e327-4e69-9448-83cea52b02e3.jpg)). Do not buy or support as it's a scam too.**

## Maxgeek H2 
Maxgeek H2 has an issue with a frozen application on their portapack. They have acknowledged that only their firmware works and open-source will not. **Not compatible with Mayhem!([Ref.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5009021/204222733-a82aa404-9949-4de3-b6b3-4265e7d81f32.jpg)).
