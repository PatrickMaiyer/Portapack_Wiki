* Similar to  H2 in early versions except claim for better TXCO spec(quesionable) and board marked as H2+.
* Battery state indicator with 4 leds under Encoder Knob for 25%,50%,75%,100%,flashing while charging, steady when that level full. 
* Later versions  the standard CPLD 5M40ZE64CN5 was  replaced with EPM240T100C5N ( due to cost and supply issues by supplier "OpenSourceSDR Lab") which has caused some issues ( they issues their work around fixes in a version 1.4.3)  and resolved in version 1.5.x due to a lot of hard work.
