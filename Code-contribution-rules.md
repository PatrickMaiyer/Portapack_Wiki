# Disclaimer

By contributing you accept to provide code that comply to the following code rules. Any pull request may be stalled until fixed.
It's important for everyone, be it contributors or reviewers, to have a clear compile log so they can easily spot and fix new arising problems / warning.

# Code contribution rules

* Indent your code. Using automatic indentation is recommended, at least for new apps
* Test and take in account the return code each time it's needed
* Have an error management in your app
* Make reusable content (class, structs, gui filler functions, ...)
* Document global processing as well as tricky parts, don't be lazy, some may contribute to your own contribution, help them to help you, to help us
* Provide access to your sources via a public repository

# A note on Pull Requests

* PRs should be up to date with 'next'
* Each new functionality should have it's own PR, don't put too much files/commits into a single PR. When it's too much commits, one can make a new branch and report only the modified files in a single commit, to make the review easier
* Merging of any PR is up to the maintainers good will
