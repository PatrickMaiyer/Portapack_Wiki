The coin cell battery is used to preserve settings stored in persistent memory (P.Mem), as well as to power the RTC clock.  The smaller coin cell battery used on the PortaPack H2 does not last long and replacing the coin cell can be a chore, depending on the case style.

To partially work around a dead or missing coin cell battery, persistent memory settings can be configured to save settings to the SD card (see Settings -> P.Memory Mgmt).  This allows all settings to be preserved, but does not resolve the issue with not keeping time.

Those with an H2 model and soldering skills might want to consider adding a larger CR2032 battery holder such as the one below (attached with double-stick foam tape), to lengthen the time that the coin battery lasts by about 4X:
