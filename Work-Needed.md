Mayhem firmware is continually evolving.  If you have the time and skill, there are several features that you could work on to contribute, including those listed below.

NOTE:
* To keep the list of Issues in github small, some Enhancement suggestions have been closed in github and moved to this list, so please include "closed" issues when searching github more information on any of the feature suggestions below.
* Due to ROM size limitations, new applications may need to be "external", meaning that they are loaded from a file on the SD card versus from the ROM.

# Enhancement Wish List

## Audio
* Support for recording from Microphone to a WAV file.
* Support for playing back WAV files to the Speaker/Headphones.
* Support for transmitting a recorded WAV file.

## Analog TV
* Support for NTSC.
