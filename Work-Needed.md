Mayhem firmware is continually evolving.  If you have the time and skill, there are several features that you could work on to contribute, including those listed below.

**NOTE:**
* To keep the list of Issues in github clean, some Enhancement suggestions have been Closed in github and moved to this list, so please include "closed" issues when searching github more information on any of the suggestions below.
* Due to ROM size limitations, new applications may need to be "external", meaning that they are loaded from a file on the SD card versus from the ROM.

# Enhancement Wish List

## Analog TV App
* Add support for NTSC.

## Audio
* Support for recording from Microphone to a WAV file.
* Support for playing back WAV files to the Speaker/Headphones.
* Support for transmitting a recorded WAV file.

## Capture Files
* Support for more advanced editing of capture files.

## External Apps
* Move incomplete or infrequently-used apps external.
* Reduce number of steps required to upgrade firmware and external apps (perhaps external apps should all be in one file, TBD).

## Port from Other Projects
* Support for additional RF devices/features may be ported to Mayhem from other open-source projects including rtl_433, Flipper Zero, etc.

## SD Card
* Improve SD card performance.

## Squelch
* Support squelch in all receiver modes.
* Standardize squelch meaning across apps.

## TPMS App
