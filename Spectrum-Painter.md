The Spectrum Painter app allows to "paint" an image or text in a way that it appears on the waterfall view.

### Options
* Center frequency
* VGA (Gain)
* Amplifier
* Loop
* Bandwidth
  * Note that the default bandwidth of 8k5 Hz is too low in most cases (eg. when viewing multiple MHz).
* Duration of transmission
* Pause between transmissions when loop is active

### Images
* Place 24 bit .BMP files on the sd card in the folder SPECTRUM
  * 16 and 32 bit .BMP should work as well, but are not testet.
* The resolution should be quite high for a good result. A width of 2048 pixels is not a problem.
  * Use a power of 2 for the width for optimal result. (eg. 512 / 1024 / 2048 / ...)
