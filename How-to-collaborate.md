How to Collaborate on Portapack Mayhem:

Portapack Mayhem is a community-driven project that welcomes contributions from everyone. If you're interested in collaborating on the project, here's a guide on how to get started:`

Write Documentation:

Comprehensive Documentation:
Ensure clear and detailed instructions for all features by modifying or adding content to the existing wiki on GitHub using a regular GitHub account.

Select a Topic to Master:
Choose a specific application, app function, feature, or procedure related to your PortaPack that you feel confident in mastering.

Consult Reliable Sources:
Enhance your knowledge by referring to reliable sources such as:
[HackRF Wiki](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki)
[PortaPack-Havoc Wiki](https://github.com/furrtek/portapack-havoc/wiki)
[PortaPack-HackRF Wiki](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf/wiki)

Adding or Modifying Content:
Edit the sidebar to create a new section or make direct modifications to existing sections while maintaining consistency with the language and style used in the Wiki.

Formatting the Documentation:
Familiarize yourself with Markdown syntax using the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to effectively format the content.

Coding New Features or Fixing Bugs:

Overcoming Coding Challenges:
Don't be discouraged by doubts or lack of expertise in C++. Start by taking action and coding the new feature or fixing the bug yourself. It is a learning process that anyone can undertake.

Setting Up the Environment:
Follow these steps to set up your coding environment:

Fork the repository.
Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
Log in to GitHub, open the [repository](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem), and click "Fork" in the top right corner.
In your forked repository, click "Clone" and select "Open in Desktop."
Complete the remaining instructions in GitHub Desktop.

Preparing for Compilation:
[Compile your forked repository](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/Compile-firmware), which may take some time initially, but the resulting build folder will be located in the root of your forked repository.

Commence Coding:
Refer to a concise video tutorial for the following steps:

[Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Open the root directory of your local copy of the forked repository.
Make the desired code changes.
Compile the code by running the image from Kitematic.
Repeat the code modification and compilation process until finished.


It is acceptable to work on your master branch as a beginner, but working on [branches](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) is generally recommended.

After completing changes, create [commits](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) to track modifications:
Keep commits simple, aiming for fewer affected files and lines.
Use descriptive commit names and include the URL of the specific issue if applicable.
Ensure successful compilation after each commit.
Submitting Your Changes:
When your new feature or bug fix is ready, follow these steps to submit your changes:

Publish the branch (if necessary) and push all commits.
Initiate a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) (PR) with a descriptive title and, if necessary, a detailed description.
Follow the subsequent interaction on GitHub.
