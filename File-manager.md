**Rename** : Rename selected file or directory.  
**Refactor** : Rename both `TXT` and `C16` file. If the file/directory you are refactoring is not a `C16` nor `TXT` file, it does the same with rename.  
**Delete** : Delete the file or directory you had chosen.  
**New Dir** : Creating a new directory.
