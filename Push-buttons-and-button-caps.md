# Push-buttons
If the push-buttons are intermittently unresponsive, first make sure that the Portapack firmware is upgraded to version 1.7.1. or later, which improves handling of glitchy switch contacts.  The type of push-buttons used on the Portapack is SMD tactile switches of 6 mm per side and 7 mm of height. You can buy replacements here: https://a.aliexpress.com/_dZqx4vv 

The easiest way to remove them is to clip the legs off, clean the pads carefully with solder wick and solder the new buttons.
