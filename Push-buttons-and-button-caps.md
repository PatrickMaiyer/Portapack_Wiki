# Push-buttons
The type of push-buttons used on the Portapack is SMD tactile switches of 6 mm per side and 7 mm of height. You can buy replacements here: https://a.aliexpress.com/_dZqx4vv 

The easiest way to remove them is to clip the legs off, clean the pads carefully with solder wick and solder the new buttons.

# Encoder aka knob (H2/H2+)
Use a 20 bit ec11 encoder.  
It may have weird performances if you installed a 24 bit ec11.(Ref. https://discord.com/channels/719669764804444213/737376558754300081/951522295069962300)
