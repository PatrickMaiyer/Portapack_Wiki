Encoder/knob for H2/H2+ uses a 30-step EC11 encoder with push button.

A short press of the push button turns on the PortaPack; a long press or two short presses turns off the PortaPack.  If no click is felt when the knob is pressed, there may be insufficient clearance between the knob and the case, in which case some padding may be added inside the knob shaft.

If the rotary encoder seems to be malfunctioning, first make sure that the Portapack firmware is upgraded to version 1.7.1. or later, which improves handling of glitchy switch contacts.  Encoder dial sensitivity can also be modified in Settings.
