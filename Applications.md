### Colors

### External Apps
External Apps (.ppma files) are placed in the APPS folder on the SD Card, and their versions must match the currently-running firmware.  Mayhem developers may move some lesser-used and incomplete apps from internal to external to make room in the firmware flash ROM for new applications.
