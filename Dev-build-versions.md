We are trying to work out what is the most recent version we can update to while making it so all devs can still develop using the version on their OS/distro.

| Dev      | GCC Version | Platfrom     | Issues|
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Stable/nightly | 9.2.1       | ubuntu:20.04 | ADSB fails in v1.8.0 |
| @jlynx   | 9.4.0       | Ubuntu (WSL) | None |
| @u-foka | 13.2.1       | M1 Mac | File size too big |
| @notherngineer | 9.3.1       | Debian 11 | None |
