This app allows users to create playlists of previously captured signals and replay them in a specific order.  

A sample PLAYLIST.PPL file is included in the SD card.

The file with PPL extension is just text file, you could edit it with any of the text editor.  

Playlist files are comma delimited and have the following structure:
