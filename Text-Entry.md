The text entry view allows you to modify text. Use the buttons on the screen to update the text field at the cursor.
For the most part this is self explanatory, but there are a few features that are worth pointing out.

* Cursor - with the text field selected, use the encoder or the left/right buttons to set the cursor position.
* Insert/Overwrite - with the text field selected, pressing the select button will toggle between insert and overwrite modes. Overwrite mode will invert the cursor to indicate it is active.
* Raw byte entry - with the raw number field selected, use the encoder to select a byte value. Pressing select will enter that byte value into the text field. This can be used to insert a <NULL> byte or a <TAB>.
* Mode button - pressing the mode button (lower right) will toggle the keyboard between Upper, Lower, and Numeric modes.

Backing out of the control will not save changes. Changes are saved when the OK button is pressed.
