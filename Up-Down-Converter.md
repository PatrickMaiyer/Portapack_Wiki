# Up / down converter

When using an upconverter it's common to use an offset to access the correct frequency. As an example, if you want to use a HamItUp which is designed to listen from 60KHz to 30MHz, you'll need to tune your portapack to 125 MHz (or any other frequency used in the upconverter local oscillator) + the frequency you need.

Doing the calculation and tuning while adding the frequencies can be a bit tedious. Don't worry: just got into your portapack's settings, Radio menu, and set the shifting you need. You can set up conversion (+) or down conversion (-) in the Settings/Converter menu.

When the option is on, the displayed frequency is the one you want to tune in, and the real tuned frequency is displayed frequency plus or minus offset.
When the option is off, the displayed frequency is the one you want to tune in, and the real tuned frequency is the displayed frequency.

You can turn it on and off using the checkbox while in Radio menu, or using the top bar icon 'Freq', with an arrow telling you if it's up or down conversion.

Note:  This has the same effect as using the top bar 'Freq' icon. While in the radio menu, the synchronisation of the top bar 'Freq' status and the checkbox is not implemented when toggling the top bar 'up' icon. The status is saved, and the last to talk is setting the status.
