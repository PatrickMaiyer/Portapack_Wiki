The Audio App is the main way that signals can be heard and seen in detail. Three types of decoders are provided for audio modulated signals and a spectrum view of the signals. The user interface has the ability to view and change:
 

* **SPEC:** Display a Spectrum of the received signal and allow viewing of 10MHz of RF Spectrum, centered on a configurable frequency, with 5MHz above the frequency and 5MHz below.

* **AM:** Demodulate and Record RF Signals modulated using the Amplitude Modulation scheme. It can demodulate Double-Sideband AM (ITU Designation: A3E) and both Lower-Sideband and Upper-Sideband Single-Sideband AM (ITU Classification: R2E, H3E, J3E) signals.

* **NFM:** The Narrow Band Frequency Modulation decoding ITU Classification: FM3

* **WFM:** The Wide FM Receiver is a Sub-Application of the Audio Receiver Application. Its purpose is to Demodulate and Record RF Signals modulated using the Frequency Modulation scheme. It can demodulate mono and stereo Wide FM signals of 200KHz bandwidth. Such signals are commonly used for VHF FM Broadcast services.

The Key Items on the App that can be seen or selected with the cursor and changed with the encoder knob are:

* **Title bar:** The usual Items may be changed and displayed.

* **Mode:** On the line below title bar is the demodulation mode AM, NFM, WFM, SPEC. When either of these are selected it will bring up a secondary set of relevant items on the line below. These are discussed in secondary items below.

* **Frequency:** The Centre frequency of the demodulation band.

   > Note 1 : From Frequency field, you can move down to the below Step field , to adjust your best suitable Freq-step, according to your
 needs.

   > Note 2 : If you have load/save App Settings from SD card enabled, it will continue to use what it was last set at. And you can always edit the file in the SD  card, /SETTINGS/rx_audio
.ini and edit the step size there, according to your needs in that App.

   > Note 3 : Additionally , to be more user friendly ,  from version 1.7.4+ holding  in the Select button on the Frequency field for a second until a digit turns blue, then you can use Left/Right select which digit you'd like to adjust, and then you can use the Encoder Dial to adjust any digit up/down by 1 to tune more precisely. (Press Select again to exit this tuning mode. 
  
* **Gain:** Settings are shown in order of LNA(IF) (0-40) and VGA (Baseband Gain) (0-62). When either of these are selected in the secondary line the AMP setting is shown and can be as either set to  0=0db or 1=14dB.

* **Signal Display:** The three coloured displays are top to bottom RSSI(Red/Blue) with an average marker in the line. Next is the Baseband signal and last the Audio level.

* **Volume:** The Last item on this line is the audio volume control (O-99) that is used with either headphone or speaker if fitted.

* **Secondary Information:** This line provides associated information for the following items these are:

    * **AM:** Bandwidth settings of DSB 9k, DSB 6k, USB+3k, LSB-3k, CW. The Spectrum view is +/-20k.
    * **NFM:** Bandwidth Settings of 16k,11k,8k5. Note there is no setting for the more common 6k5 used in European Spectrum plans. Next item is SQ: which is shown in the format of 40/99 allow the noise squelch point to be set Between 0-99. Typically, around 40-50 is a good threshold.
    * **Gain:** The RF Amp settings. The Spectrum view is +/-20k.
    * **WFM:** There are three option filters in that Secondary settings : 

     * (1) 200k ,the original filter for commercial FM stations with soft transition, 

     * (2) 180k with sharp transition, for also commercial FM broadcast station, specially useful to improve demodulated S/N in around 6 to 8 dB‘s in weak signals . 

     * (3) 40k with also sharp transition, for supporting NOAA APT weather satellite reception in 137 MHz . (that filter is too narrow for WFM with 75khz delta deviation and can produce audio distortion in the demodulated sound). The Spectrum view is +/-100k with a marker That may be changed (though seem the incorrect value).

    * **SPEC.** The spectrum Secondary Items allows the view of the RF spectrum with different setting for maximum bandwidth shown:
            
            20M with markers at +/- 5M
            10M with markers at +/- 3M
            5M with markers at +/- 2M
            2M with markers at +/- 500k
            1M with markers at +/- 300k
            500k with markers at +/-200k

The next item is the setting of the bin sizes used for the waterfall (0-63) with “0” being the minimum information being the fastest display and “63” the maximum information collected the slowest display. Adjust to give a balance of speed and information seen. 

* **CTCSS:** This Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System is a display at the end of the secondary information line. It is used by many systems and standardised by EIA/TIA, with a description [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System ) In the NFM mode in Audio app, the tone field is increased from 11 to 14 characters.
Now , the CTCSS tone frequency and CTCSS code numbers are displayed at once (if a matching freq was found in the tone_key table). See the Annex to this document below. It should be noted that most of the time the display is jumping around and only clearly displays the received tone when there is a gap in the voice and the Signal is of good quality. 

* **Record:** The record button if selected will show the record file name, % of the SD Card used, and at the end of the line is the total recording time available left on the SD card and this decrements when recording.
