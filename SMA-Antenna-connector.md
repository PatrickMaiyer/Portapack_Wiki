The antenna connectors on the HackRF board are the `18.5 mm` variant available here: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEfOQ85

# Replacing a broken connector

1. Desolder the original, use enough flux (i.e. [this "self cleaning" variant](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEfOQ85)) and fresh solder. If there is parts of the SMA connector still there, it might be more difficult to remove because the thermal mass.
