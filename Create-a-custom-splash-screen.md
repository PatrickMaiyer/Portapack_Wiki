Are you bored of the standard power on screen?
Do you want your own image at power up to personalise your device?
You can!

Save a 240x304 24-bit BMP file named `splash.bmp` in the root of the SD card. You can share and get ready to use images in the `#splash-screens` channel over our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tuwVMv3) group.  Beginning in firmware version 1.7.4, splash screen BMP files stored on the SD card can be viewed in the File Manager application and set to be the current splash screen with a single click.

### Issues
- If you're having problems (doesn't display when clicked in Fileman) with 240x304, try 240x300 instead.
- If you don't see a(custom) splash screen, make sure the feature is enabled by ticking the box in Options -> Interface -> Show Splash.
