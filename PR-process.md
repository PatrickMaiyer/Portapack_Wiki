In order to get your PR merged into the code base, there are a few checks that need to happen first.

* At least one code approver needs to approve your code. 
* If any code reviewer left PR comments, then all those PR comments left by reviewers need to be marked as resolved.
* All 3 code format gate checks need to complete successfully. (don't know how to format your code? Check out how to do it here https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/Code-formatting) 

Once these steps are all complete, you will notice you have a green merge button available, then means you are good to go and merge your code into the code base.

If any of these steps are not complete or failed, then you will be blocked from merging your code until they have all been completed.
