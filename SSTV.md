The SSTV app allows you to send .bmp images that you have loaded onto the SD card. The current supported modes include Scottie 1, Scottie 2, Scottie DX, Martian 1, Martian 2, and SC2-180 modes. Currently, FM is the only modulation supported. 

## Sending
To send an image, select the bitmap image, the mode, and the frequency you'd like to transmit on with the jog wheel. For amateur radio, 12kHz seems to produce a good image.

## Image requirements
Only 24bit BMP files with a size of 320x256 pixels are supported
