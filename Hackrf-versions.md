The Hackrf versions/revisions list is in [Hackrf documents](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list_of_hardware_revisions.html), which is maintaining by GSG.  
At now stage the Mayhem firmware supports all the hackrf versions/revisions **if you correctly plugged a [supported version of PortaPack](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/PortaPack-Versions)**.
