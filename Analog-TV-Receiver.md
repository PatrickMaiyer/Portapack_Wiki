This analog TV receiver app currently supports wideband amplitude-modulated PAL only. This signal used to be widely adopted for television broadcasts.  The picture is assumed to be 625-line x 768-width interlaced but app reduces the image size to 52-line x 128-width to reduce processing overhead and to fit on the PortaPack screen.  The resulting 52x128 image is then stretched to 104-line x 128-width, and multiple frames are displayed on top of one another in lieu of de-interlacing (i.e. the first image may be just the odd lines, the second may be the even lines, and repeat).

The app does not yet support sync signals, so frames may be misaligned both horizontally and vertically.  The picture can be aligned left/right by moving focus down to the screen area and turning the encoder dial, but will tend to drift over time.

Due to hardware limitations, this app can only show black and white images.  This app does not yet support SSTV.
