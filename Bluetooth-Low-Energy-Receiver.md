As of 10/31/23 the previous BLE implementation has been updated and improved to correct some of the issues the other BLE app lacked.

This BLE app has several features which I will highlight in a brief overview.

1. The BLE app upon entry will scan for BLE advertisement packets, and report them on the screen. The Channel knob can be used to select which advertisement channel to listen on.
2. Once found the user can then select an individual MAC Addresses entry to pull up a more detailed view of the captured data packet.
3. The Sort Knob will sort the list of MAC indices by either Ascending MAC Address, dB, or by most recently updated entry.

Below short example on using the BLE Rx App.
