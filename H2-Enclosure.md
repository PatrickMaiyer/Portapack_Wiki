Many PortaPacks on AliExpress come with a metal or plastic enclosure.  Enclosure dimensions, simplicity of assembly/disassembly, connector labeling (if any), and speaker hole positions (if any) varies by supplier.  Some users feel that a metal enclosure is safer for devices that contain LiPo batteries.

You can 3D-print the following enclosure for your Portapack (click the pictures to get the design files):

# Assembly
Check the `assembly.pdf` from the [case files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4260973/files) for instructions.

## Speaker

You can easily place a small 8ohm 1.5W (14x21x5.5 mm) speaker inside. There is no holes in the case but it seems that the sound quality actually improves with the case:
