## Main UI

* **Remote Title** - The top line is the title of the remote. Select it to edit it.
* **Remote Buttons** - Up to 12 customizable buttons per remote. Select a button to transmit the capture file. Press again to stop. Long-press select to edit or delete the button.
* **Waterfall** - A small waterfall is shown while transmitting below the button grid.
* **Gain** - Control the transmitter Gain and Amp. The color indicates the overall transmitter power.
* **Loop** - Continuously transmit until stopped.
* **Filename** - Shows remote file name. Select it to rename the remote file.
* **Add Button** - Add a new button to the grid. New buttons will open in edit mode when you press them.
* **New Remote** - Start editing a new, empty remote.
* **Open Remote** - Open an existing remote file (REM) from the SD card.

## Tips
* Remotes are automatically saved on exit.
* Use the IQ Trim tool to trim silence from captures so they start instantly.
