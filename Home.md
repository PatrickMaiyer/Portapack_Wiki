Thanks for buying your HackRF+PortaPack device. _That_ is what I would say if I was actually the one selling them as the intro line for the documentation, but I am not. I am just trying to document the great work of a lot of people involved in this project, listed [here](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/blob/c9eb2b16ca1b8cc50935c1b72af8f5438f582268/firmware/application/apps/ui_about_simple.cpp#L19).

The following documentation is split in two parts. The User manual intends to emulate a typical instruction manual for the end user, while the Developer manual documents all the apis available in order to write custom apps.

**If your device wont boot, please view the troubleshooting guide here: [Won't boot](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/wiki/Won't-boot)**

Enjoy!
